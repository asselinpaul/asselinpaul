      <blockquote>
        <p>
          One night, as I&#8217;m standing on LaSalle Street in Chicago, trying
          to line up a shot for &#8220;The Dark Knight,&#8221; a production
          assistant skateboards into my line of sight. Silently, I curse the
          moment that Heath first skated onto our set in full character makeup.
          I&#8217;d fretted about the reaction of Batman fans to a skateboarding
          Joker, but the actual result was a proliferation of skateboards among
          the younger crew members. If you&#8217;d asked those kids why they had
          chosen to bring their boards to work, they would have answered
          honestly that they didn&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s real
          charisma&#8211;as invisible and natural as gravity. That&#8217;s what
          Heath had.
        </p>

        <p>
          Heath was bursting with creativity. It was in his every gesture. He
          once told me that he liked to wait between jobs until he was
          creatively hungry. Until he needed it again. He brought that attitude
          to our set every day. There aren&#8217;t many actors who can make you
          feel ashamed of how often you complain about doing the best job in the
          world. Heath was one of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          One time he and another actor were shooting a complex scene. We had
          two days to shoot it, and at the end of the first day, they&#8217;d
          really found something and Heath was worried that he might not have it
          if we stopped. He wanted to carry on and finish. It&#8217;s tough to
          ask the crew to work late when we all know there&#8217;s plenty of
          time to finish the next day. But everyone seemed to understand that
          Heath had something special and that we had to capture it before it
          disappeared. Months later, I learned that as Heath left the set that
          night, he quietly thanked each crew member for working late. Quietly.
          Not trying to make a point, just grateful for the chance to create
          that they&#8217;d given him.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those nights on the streets of Chicago were filled with stunts. These
          can be boring times for an actor, but Heath was fascinated, eagerly
          accepting our invitation to ride in the camera car as we chased
          vehicles through movie traffic&#8211;not just for the thrill ride, but
          to be a part of it. Of everything. He&#8217;d brought his laptop along
          in the car, and we had a high-speed screening of two of his
          works-in-progress: short films he&#8217;d made that were exciting and
          haunting. Their exuberance made me feel jaded and leaden. I&#8217;ve
          never felt as old as I did watching Heath explore his talents. That
          night I made him an offer&#8211;knowing he wouldn&#8217;t take me up
          on it&#8211;that he should feel free to come by the set when he had a
          night off so he could see what we were up to.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you get into the edit suite after shooting a movie, you feel a
          responsibility to an actor who has trusted you, and Heath gave us
          everything. As we started my cut, I would wonder about each take we
          chose, each trim we made. I would visualize the screening where
          we&#8217;d have to show him the finished film&#8211;sitting three or
          four rows behind him, watching the movements of his head for clues to
          what he was thinking about what we&#8217;d done with all that
          he&#8217;d given us. Now that screening will never be real. I see him
          every day in my edit suite. I study his face, his voice. And I miss
          him terribly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back on LaSalle Street, I turn to my assistant director and I tell him
          to clear the skateboarding kid out of my line of sight when I
          realize&#8211;it&#8217;s Heath, woolly hat pulled low over his eyes,
          here on his night off to take me up on my offer. I can&#8217;t help
          but smile.
        </p>
