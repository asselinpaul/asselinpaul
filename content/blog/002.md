    If renewables are so cheap, why are electricity prices going up?

    <blockquote>
    electricity generation is actually getting cheaper but
    delivering that electricity is getting more expensive.
    distribution makes up over 2/3 of the cost of delivering
    electricity (transmission is cheap)

    Comparing global electricity tariffs, the US has among the lowest
    power prices in the world at $0.083 USD/kWh on average. Natural
    gas production in the US is abundant and has surged since the

    >, which made the US the world&#8217;s largest producer of natural
    gas. Almost 40% of the electricity generation in the US is fueled
    by natural gas, with low power generation prices chiefly driven by
    the abundance of dry natural gas production from shale formations.

<blockquote>
<p>
    Japan&#8217;s power mix is tilted towards these imported fuel
    types, with 35% natural gas, 34% coal, 7% hyrdo and 5% nuclear,
    resulting in average industrial electricity tariffs of $0.152
    USD/kWh in 2022, 82% higher than the US at $0.083 USD/kWh. Taiwan
    and Korea have similar power mixes dominated by natural gas
    imports and have electricity tariffs of about $0.10 to $0.12
    USD/kWh, though this is after $0.03 to $0.04 of effective
    subsidies given the state owned electric companies have been
    running massive losses, with Korea&#8217;s

    industrial tariff reached $0.18 USD/kWh in 2022, with the UK at
    $0.235 USD/kWh and datacenter heavyweight Ireland at $0.211
    USD/kWh, nearly triple the electricity cost in the US. Like Asia,
    Europe imports over 90% of its gas in the form of LNG, mainly

<blockquote>
<p>
The terms and conditions now tied to CHIPS Act funding are not just
bureaucratic mumbo‐​jumbo; they could actually undermine the
subsidies' stated objectives. Most obviously, they&#8217;ll impose
additional costs on subsidy recipients, potentially diverting finite
resources&#8211;money, time, labor, etc.&#8211;away from producing
more chips onshore and toward these other requirements.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
As we&#8217;ve discussed (repeatedly), &#8220;Buy American&#8221;
mandates are expensive and can add years to federal projects;
Davis‐​Bacon rules inflate construction costs (especially following
Biden administration changes); and restrictions on buybacks or
dividends can prevent firms from optimizing their capital structure in
the most cost‐​effective way (e.g., by switching from equity to
potentially‐​cheaper debt). PLAs also can raise construction costs by
mandating, among other things, the use of union labor, resources, and
benefit/​pension plans. Childcare and &#8220;wraparound&#8221;
services, DEIA and other &#8220;equity&#8221; initiatives,
&#8220;environmental justice&#8221; plans, and other strings surely
cost money too, as do the armies of employees that&#8217;ll be needed
to demonstrate compliance with the subsidy award terms.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
To the extent that semiconductor firms weren&#8217;t already doing
this stuff (and if they were, then why mandate it?), requiring them to
do so now will mean fewer corporate resources available for producing
chips or engaging in new research and development. That&#8217;s
particularly a concern right now, as the global semiconductor
market&#8217;s recent collapse has already left major chipmakers more
capital constrained (and cutting staff and investments) than they were
just a year ago.

<h3>Markets</h3>

California&#8217;s new $20 minimum wage rule will exempt restaurants
that sell bread, handing a lucrative break on wages to the Panera
chain and one of Governor Gavin Newsom&#8217;s longtime allies

    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/jj-init"
    >JUJUTSU</a
>, a version control system coming out of Google. It is to be
treated as a new front-end to Git for now (although an alternative
back-end exists, author does not recommend it just yet). JUJUTSU
revolves around revisions as opposed to commits and
<em>functional</em> paradigms.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    In Git, as in Subversion and Mercurial and other version control
    systems before them, when you finish with a change, you
    <em>commit</em> it. In Jujutsu, there is no first-class notion of
    &#8220;committing&#8221; code. [&#8230;] Instead, Jujutsu has two
    discrete operations: <code>describe</code> and <code>new</code>.
    <code>jj describe</code> lets you provide a descriptive message
    for any change. <code>jj new</code> starts a new change.
