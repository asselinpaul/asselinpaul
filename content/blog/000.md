<h4>The Veil of Ignorance</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>
    Most people in the United States agree they want some income
    inequality but debate exactly how much is fair. High-status people
    generally prefer more inequality than low-status individuals. Here we
    examine how much preferences for inequality are (or are not) driven by
    self-interest.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
    People seemed to make decisions under the presumption of a best-case
    scenario. They chose a society that they would endorse if they were at
    the top, but not one they tolerated if they were at the bottom. This
    finding contradicts many common interpretations of the type of
    thinking that the veil of ignorance affords. The evidence here
    suggests that veils of ignorance exercises help to create consensus,
    but they do not create a &#8220;fair&#8221; society from the vantage
    point of its most disadvantaged members.

<h4>Work as a byproduct of progress</h4>

<p>
    A common mistake I see almost everyone making: You are not supposed to
    be responsible for the creation of work. Work happens as a byproduct
    of trying to move from your current to your desired state The creation
    of work as a non byproduct of progress is a cardinal sin
</p>

<p>
    &#8220;It would be nice if&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Maybe they
    want&#8230;&#8221; The creation of something which must be maintained
    indefinitely, without at least a strong bet that it will pay
    it&#8217;s freight, simply serves to weigh down the system
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
    And often, it&#8217;s more work/weight than expected Ergo, that
    &#8220;paying it&#8217;s freight&#8221; should actually be closer to
    &#8220;paying 10x it&#8217;s freight&#8221; This is because a good
    &#8220;50% better in theory&#8221; bet, which takes 50% longer, is net
    zero

    >Queued Up: Characteristics of Power Plants Seeking Transmission
    Interconnection As of the End of 2022</a

from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
</h4>

<p>
An interconnection queue is used by grid operators to manage requests
from power generators wishing to connect their power generation sources
to the electricity grid. Takeaways:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interest in solar, storage, and wind is strong</p>

<p>Completion rates are generally low; wait times are increasing</p>

<p>
    The typical project built in 2022 took 5 years from the
    interconnection request to commercial operations 1, compared to 3
    years in 2015 and &lt;2 years in 2008.
</p>

<p>Helpful context:</p>

<p>
<em
    >Only ~ 21% of projects (14% of capacity) requesting interconnection
    from 2000&#8211;2017 reached commercial operations by the end of
    2022.</em
>
</p>

<p>
<em
    >Comparisons of queue capacity to installed capacity or peak load
    should also consider generators' contributions to resource adequacy,
    for example their &#8220;effective load carrying capability&#8221;
    (ELCC). As variable resources, solar and wind contribute a smaller
    percentage of their nameplate capacity to resource adequacy compared
    to dispatchable generation like natural gas. Decarbonizing the
    electric sector therefore requires higher levels of installed solar
    and wind capacity to achieve the same resource adequacy contributions.
    High levels of storage can offset this need to some degree.</em

<h4>US Nuclear</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Every nuclear plant in the USA vs. every nuclear plant in China.</p>

<p>
    The U.S. has 93 reactors, down from a peak of 104 in 2012. More will
    be decommissioned in the future.
</p>

<p>
    China has 55 reactors, 22 under construction, and expects to surpass
    U.S. nuclear power generation ~ 2030.

<h4>Venture return requirements, top 10 QQQ portfolio performance</h4>

<p>
A portfolio composed of the top 10 QQQ stocks (by market cap) rebalanced
annually performs well on short/long timespan, Gokul Rajaram argues a
venture fund should return ~ 10x over 10y (25% premium for riskiness and
illiquidity) to be competitive (<a
